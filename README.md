A Deep Fake Synthetic Speech Dataset for Portuguese Zero-Shot TTS

## About it


This work introduces the first publicly available dataset explicitly designed for audio deepfake detection in Brazilian Portuguese, addressing a significant gap in annotated resources for low-resource languages. By contributing high-quality synthetic and real speech data in a linguistically underrepresented context, this dataset supports the development of more robust, multilingual, and equitable detection systems in the broader field of speech forensics and security.
